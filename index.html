    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>App:</strong> Yogasana<br>
    <strong>Developer:</strong> Austin Chettiar<br>
    <strong>Contact:</strong> <a href="mailto:austin.c081104@gmail.com">austin.c081104@gmail.com</a></p>

    <p><em>Effective date: December 5, 2025</em></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Yogasana ("we", "our", "the App") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use and protect it, and your choices regarding that information when you use the Yogasana mobile application.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>1. Information you provide directly.</strong> When you create an account, save preferences, or contact support, you may provide personal information such as name, email address, profile photo, and optional profile details.</p>

    <p><strong>2. Usage and device information.</strong> We automatically collect information about your device and how you use the App, including device model, operating system, app version, crash reports, and logs to improve performance and fix issues.</p>

    <p><strong>3. Permissions and sensor data.</strong> The App may request permission to access certain device features. These permissions are optional and used only when you enable the related features. Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Camera</strong> — to capture photos or video for pose analysis or profile images.</li>
      <li><strong>Microphone</strong> — to support optional voice commands or guided sessions.</li>
      <li><strong>Motion sensors</strong> (accelerometer, gyroscope) — to assist with posture/pose tracking when you enable tracking features.</li>
      <li><strong>Storage</strong> — to save downloaded content, exported files, or user data on your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide and maintain the App’s features (e.g., workouts, pose guidance, progress tracking).</li>
      <li>Personalize and improve your experience.</li>
      <li>Analyze usage to enhance performance and fix bugs.</li>
      <li>Communicate with you about updates, features, and support.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share data with third parties only in the following limited cases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service providers</strong> — analytics, crash reporting, cloud hosting, and email providers that help us operate the App. These providers are contractually restricted from using data for other purposes.</li>
      <li><strong>Optional cloud backups</strong> — if you choose to sync or back up data to third-party services (for example, Google Drive), that data will be governed by that service’s privacy policy.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal reasons</strong> — when required by law or to protect rights and safety.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ads and Analytics</h2>
    <p>If Yogasana displays ads, ad networks may collect anonymous device identifiers and usage data to serve and measure ads. You can opt out of personalized ads using device-level advertising controls where available.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal data only as long as necessary to provide the App’s features, comply with legal obligations, and for legitimate business purposes. If you delete your account, we will delete or anonymize your personal data within a reasonable timeframe, unless retention is required by law.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data. However, no internet transmission or storage system is completely secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Permissions:</strong> You can review and revoke app permissions at any time from your device settings. Revoking certain permissions may disable associated features.</li>
      <li><strong>Data deletion:</strong> You can request deletion of your account and data by contacting us at the email below.</li>
      <li><strong>Opt-out:</strong> If we offer analytics opt-out, follow the instructions in the app settings where provided.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Yogasana is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, contact us and we will remove that information.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will post the updated policy here with a new effective date. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
